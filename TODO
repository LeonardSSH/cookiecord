longterm:
    - tests with jest
    - more detailed docs
    - unordered arguments

bugs:
    - move argument type check to module from commandParser
    
features:
    - error handling for cmds and listeners
    - argument prompting (wizards)
    - providers (allow functions to be passed for the prefix property etc)
    - auto reload dev mode: complex but command editing (so when u send a command, the bot sends a response and you edit the command the bot re-runs the command and edits its previous message)
    - be able to compose types (arg can be a string or a number)
    - support all arguments listed on https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/docs/main/master/arguments/types
    
    inhibitors system with builtin funcs for common things (global ownerOnly etc) kinda like middleware:
        ✔ bot admin @done(20-02-01 14:59)
        ✔ channel type restrictions (guild only, dm only etc) @done(20-02-01 15:17)
        ✔ discord perm restrictions @done(20-02-01 15:34)
        - cooldowns
