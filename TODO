longterm:
    - tests with jest
    - more detailed docs
    - unordered arguments
    - providers (allow functions to be passed for the prefix property etc)
    - be able to compose types (arg can be a string or a number)

bugs:
    - move argument type check to module from commandParser
    
features:
    - error handling for cmds and listeners
    - argument prompting (wizards)
    - auto reload dev mode: complex but command editing (so when u send a command, the bot sends a response and you edit the command the bot re-runs the command and edits its previous message)
    - support all arguments listed on https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/docs/main/master/arguments/types
