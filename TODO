longterm:
    - tests with jest
    - more detailed docs
    - unordered arguments

bugs:
    - move argument type check to module from commandParser
    
features:
    - argument prompting (wizards)
    - providers (allow functions to be passed for the prefix property etc)
    - cooldowns
    - custom argument types
    - auto reload dev mode: complex but command editing (so when u send a command, the bot sends a response and you edit the command the bot re-runs the command and edits its previous message)
    - be able to compose types (arg can be a string or a number)
    - support all arguments listed on https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/docs/main/master/arguments/types

    - discord permission based restrictions (must have BAN_MEMBERS to exec command)
    - channel restrictions (must be used in guilds) and dm commands
    - conditional commands (must pass a certain function for the command to be ran)
    - easy ownerOnly commands
    - inhibitors

haxified suggestions (i've moved some to other sections):
    ✘ dynamic arguments (number/types of arguments change based on previous arguments) this is in akairo using generator functions @cancelled(20-01-28 16:22)
    ✘ finalizers (after commands get run) @cancelled(20-01-28 16:22)
    ✘ regex commands @cancelled(20-01-28 16:22)
    ✘ providers? (like database providers) @cancelled(20-01-28 16:22)
    ✔ command aliases @done
    ✘ optional argument prompting @cancelled(20-01-28 16:22)
