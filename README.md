# Cookiecord
Cookiecord is an experimental discord bot framework built in TypeScript using the latest features.
It has a discord.py-esque module system which allows for easy prototyping and clear concise code.

## Installing
WARNING: Don't use this in production yet as the API isn't stable yet and neither is the implementation.

But, if you want to install it anyway, use yarn:
`yarn add cookiecord`
